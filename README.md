# Skin Cancer Image Classification (HAM10000)

This project builds image classification models to detect different types of skin lesions using the **HAM10000** dermatoscopic dataset. The goal was to compare deep learning and classical ML approaches for early detection support.

## Project Overview
- Performed EDA on metadata and visualized class imbalance  
- Built CNN baseline and applied transfer learning with pre-trained models  
- Used data augmentation and imbalance handling to improve performance  
- Achieved improved macro ROC-AUC across 7 diagnostic classes  

## Tools & Methods
- Python (TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) + Transfer Learning  
- Class imbalance handling + data augmentation  

## Key Insight
Transfer learning with augmentation significantly improved classification performance on minority classes, demonstrating potential for clinical decision support.
